Retina differentiates in a central to peripheral wave 

Cone cells and the origin of retinoblastoma

removal of RB protein in cone cells, they re-entre the cell cycle and proliferate, otherwise post-mitotic

several proteins associated with cone cell Rb loss reposnse

MDM2, MYCN, p27, CycE, CDK2, E2F3


mouse doesnâ€™t create fovea also

How to make model system more accurate

use organoids 

### do organoids recapitulate cone cell maturation? 

# IF staining 

1. RB1 expressoin in ARR3+ Organoid cone precursors

progenitor cell maintenance in organoid models 

MDM2 expressoin tied to ARR3 expression in fetal tissue 
+ contra organoid; cone cells (ARR3+) cells w/o MDM2 
+ increase with age 

MCYN 
cones: nuclear MYCN but disappears in fovea
oganoid: MYCN expression in ARR3+ 


### Do retinal organoids recapitulate cone maturation? 
No at protein level

#  transcriptomic level scRNAseq

### single cell isolation and FACS or C1 

fed throuhg Smart-seq to get full length trnascripts 

## cone Cell precursors

### PR devleop trajectory 

Fetal: VSX2, expressed in progenitors 
Cell cycle: G2/M and S both present in progen, not others 

Marker cells: 

cones: OPN1SW, GNAT2
rod: GNAT1, NR2E3

### Rod-cone branch point express ATOH7

+ PDE6H, GNGT2

## Organoids

### Rod/cone split

### tight relatoinship with Age 

### Batch effect with Production Method? 

### Organoid cones high level of PR markers overall 

### Are fetal and organoid cells seurat integrated? 

#### diffex between organoid and fetal cones
