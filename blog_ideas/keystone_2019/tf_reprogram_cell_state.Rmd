questions

EN: tfs needed for lymphocyte are redudnat and incoherenet. how can we generate cell types that have more complicated networks of tfs.

XH: if you can narrow list to ~50 factors can test every single combination. but this doesn't account for tfs whose function switches by expression level; not addressed currently because system uses high titer.
