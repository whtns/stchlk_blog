How emergent properties arise and cross biological scales

ecological ideas

1. population context and cellular state increase probability of virus infection. A context-driven cell fate decision. 

a. study cell associations  in space 

  mrna and protein inteactions in single cells. 
  
clustering of single cells by subcellular resolution imaging

pixel-by-pixel in hydrogel mounted cells. DAPI realignment 

questions

1. multiplex images how? how is segmentation done? what about depth?

how do you assign mcus to single cells? maybe you don't need to.
