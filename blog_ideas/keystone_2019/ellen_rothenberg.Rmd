makeing t cellsotent from multipotent progenitors

environmental notch-DL signaling

how to validate pseudotime?

1. rna velocity

2. seqfish

3. sampling via FACS with putative marker genes id'd by pseudotime followed by culture

questions 

1. seqfish 85-90% capture efficiency

analysis of amounts of covarying genes

2. cells proliferate; are changes in transcription factor tied to cell cycle?

i don't understand answer; think that maybe delay, churning between cell cycle states

3. add lmo2 back then look at epigenetic landscape. Is there memory? memory in transcriptome

4.
