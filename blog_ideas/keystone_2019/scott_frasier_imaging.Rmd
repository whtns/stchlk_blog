1. embryology imaging

# Methods

1. Hybridization chain reaction (HCR) Dirks et. al 2004
	+ quantitiave
	+ better resolution than conventional FISH
2. CytoF
	+ not work for RNA ISH
3. MUSE HCR
	+ method of amplificaiton; works off simliar principle to cyTOF?

# approaches to speed imaging

1. DLSM (laser-scanning to create excited plane)
2. HySP (hyperspectral phaser)


# problems 

1. increase penetration depth to ensure rapid comparison of different depths
