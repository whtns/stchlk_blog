questions

1. scMTseq to predict chipseq? what is source of data for pseudotime?

WR: cannot predict; pseudotime from methylation and accessibility

DP: surprised about opening of ecto, meso, endo serially; some point all open?

WR: need more cells; possibility of meso, then endo, second hier system? E5.5 and 

ER: how devel buffered against noise? how much buffering against development does methylation provide.

WR:
