multiplex signal amp method

## challenges with high-throuh mapping of proteins

primer exchange reaction as a barcode extension strategy (PER)

also singal amplification by exchange reaction (SABER)

50 orthogonal SABER amplifiers 

in situ applications of SABER 

1. IF: 

[saka and wang biorxiv 2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/401810)

used mouse retina cryosections from Cepko!

### FISH applications of SABER 

### expansion microscopy

## questions 

SF: how long is amplicon; is label domain limiting for super-resolution ability?

SS: thorough response; magnification presented is not at diffraction limit; 

AN: how quantitive is the method? always fully packed?

SS: below theoretical limit. maybe there is quenching effect; can show validation with RNA in dropseq; variation in intensity of puncta--no answer
