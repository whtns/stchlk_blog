scisor-seq combined 10x and pacbio

ali mortazavi uci 

transcriptclean and TALON for long reads 

look at differnetial isoform usage 

### questions 

AK: alternative splicing; people have given up; how much info is there?
BW: there are gradations. 80-20 to the reverse; probabilistic. half-time of RNA may be relevant. need to do velocity with it. 

AN: pacbio; is there length bias? sequences shorter more favorably. 
BW: don't notice length bias; distribution doesn't look too different;
