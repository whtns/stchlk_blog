multi-seq

introduce sample barcodes before droplet formation

## approaches

1. LMO scaffolds enable sample barcode introduction

modular, rapid, quenchable, cheap
compatible with nuclei
species/cell type/cell state-independent

results in gene expression matrix and sample barcode matrix 

MULTI-seq and doubletfinder

doesn't work on fixed cells. 

questions:

1. exchange between lipid tags
