## quanticel drug development

## allergy data

## tabula muris browser 

reference tool for normal mouse tissue transcriptome

* normal tissue data valuable for drug development; get idea of receptor localization throughout the body

* 

questions 

DC: 10x vs Smart-seq 

SQ: number of genes/cell FACS w/ Smart-seq gives better sensitivity 2-3x; 10x increased cell numbers; both methods can be useful. 

FT: quanticel; looked for CSCs; biologist should be able to pick marker genes;
