methylcytosine acts as a cell-type specific epigenetic modification

dna methylation removed by tet deoxygenases. 

first oxidized product of demethylation cascade. 

## two ways

1. diluted in a passive way

2. removed active mech 

further oxidized

## neurons

1. post-mitotic so HmC only removed by active forms. enrichment versus other tissues 

occurs after birth during synapse formation 

## hmC has capacity to regulate gene transcription

## studying challenging in sc 

1. single-cell methylome relies on bisulfite sequencing sum of methylcytosine and h-met-C;

## techniques require ug of DNA

1. APOBEC3A (A3A) deaminates mC at permissive chemical conditions 

### repurpose 

deaminate C and mC 500x more effic than hmC

## ACE-Seq 

used bisulite which deaminate all except hmC
