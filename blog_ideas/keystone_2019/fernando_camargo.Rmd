## lineage tracing with transpososons

dox-inducible transposase, insertion site is random

### cons
biased toward sorted
not entirely quantitative

### simultaneous clonal ancestry and transcriptomic analysis

in vitro

in vivo 

1. CARLIN (CRISPR array repair lineage tracing)

### questions

1. closer we get to trans state of potent stem cell find close relationship with megaK cell. Why?
