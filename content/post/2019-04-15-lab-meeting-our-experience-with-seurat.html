<p>I presented at our weekly lab meeting last Friday and described our experiences with Seurat on our single cell data.</p>
<p>We have two projects ongoing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Transcriptional Response to Rb Loss in the Retinoblastoma Cell of Origin
Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNAseq)</p></li>
<li><p>Changes associated with retinal cone precursor development
Single Cell RNA Sequencing (scRNAseq)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I tried to cover:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Our initial approaches to analyzing single cell data and why they fell short.</li>
<li>How we applied Seurat and what advantages it has offered.</li>
<li>Other ways forward with similar mature single cell analysis tools.</li>
</ol>
