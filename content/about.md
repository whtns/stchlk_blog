I'm a PhD student in the [PIBBS](https://keck.usc.edu/pibbs/) program at the University of Southern California (USC). 

I'm also a member of the [Cobrinik](https://www.chla.org/research/cobrinik-laboratory) laboratory at Children's Hospital Los Angeles. 

I'm interested in cancer biology and genomics, especially single cell sequencing. I'm an enthusiastic R user and bioinformatics student.
